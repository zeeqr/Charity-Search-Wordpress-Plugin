# Charity Search Wordpress Plugin
A WordPress plugin which allows for a front end search field that is pulling data from the charitycommission.gov.uk API.

Install the plugin, to display on frontend use shortcode [charity-commission]
and if you want to change APIkey open file "hz-api-feed/includes/class-hz-charity-commission-api.php" on line no. 14: $this->APIKey = "api-key-here".
